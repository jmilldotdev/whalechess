# WhaleChess

Whale Chess is a fully on-chain chess game with AI-generated custom pieces. Play chess, collect pieces, build your squad, and climb your way to the top!

## What's Inside

WhaleChess is built with the MUD framework. There are 3 included packages:

- `contracts`: The core logic & contracts of the game, including the chess rules, piece logic, and squad management.
- `client`: A React app frontend using the MUD framework to interface with the contracts.
- `api-svc`: An Express API service to get the custom piece definition from the LLM and create the piece using the contracts.

## Development

Follow the setup for [MUD](https://mud.dev/quickstart).

Create an env file using each of the example env files to know what values you need.

```
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

Note: you may need to restart the development server once after the contracts compile for the first time.
